1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset
3. Image Processing with Torchvision for Feature Fusion
	- Auto Resizing, Tensor Concersion of an image, Normalize the Tensor Arrays
4. Data Extraction 
5. Model building
   	- Feature Fusion ResNet18
   	- FEature Fusion VGG16
6. Image Processing Using Image DAta Augmentation based on Keras
7. Data Extraction to Train and Test Set
8. Building the Model with TL 
	- ResNet50
	- VGG16
	- MobileNet
	- GAN
9. Image Processing using OpenCV for ML
10. MOdel Training for Dataset
	- KNN
	- Logistic REgession
	- Voting Classifier
11. Training the Model and building the model with Feature Fusion ResNet18
12. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10. User gives input 
11. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
12. Trained model is used for prediction for about image 
13. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Extension - MobileNet and Voting Classifier is used as extension where Feature Fusion Method is Advance model which 
gives better accuarcy comparing all other model and used to predicting the user inputs for analysis
